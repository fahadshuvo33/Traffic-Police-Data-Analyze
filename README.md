# Traffic Police Dataset Analysis

This project is an analysis of a traffic police dataset that contains information about traffic stops. The dataset includes the following headers:

* stop_date
* stop_time
* country_name
* driver_gender
* driver_age_raw
* driver_age
* driver_race
* violation_raw
* violation
* search_conducted
* search_type
* stop_outcome
* is_arrested
* stop_duration
* drugs_related_stop

## Analysis
During the analysis, the following steps were taken:

* Checked for null values in the dataset and removed any columns with missing data.
* Analyzed whether men or women were stopped more often for speeding violations.
* Analyzed whether gender affected the likelihood of being searched during a traffic stop.
* Calculated the mean duration of traffic stops.
* Compared the age distribution for each violation to see if there were any patterns.

## Conclusion

The traffic police dataset provides valuable information about traffic stops and police conduct. The analysis showed that certain demographics were more likely to be stopped for certain violations and that gender may affect the likelihood of being searched during a traffic stop. Additionally, the mean duration of traffic stops was calculated, and the age distribution for each violation was compared to identify any patterns. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into police conduct and make informed decisions about policies and practices that promote fairness and equity in law enforcement.
